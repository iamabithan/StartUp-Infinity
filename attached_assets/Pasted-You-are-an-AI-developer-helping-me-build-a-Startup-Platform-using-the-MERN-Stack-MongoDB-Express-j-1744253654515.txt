You are an AI developer helping me build a Startup Platform using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This platform connects Entrepreneurs and Investors to collaborate, pitch ideas, and explore funding opportunities.

Build this as a modular, scalable web application. No route protection is needed — I only require Login and Register pages for user access, but routes do not need to be guarded.

Both users can register and login. Based on their role, they see different dashboards and functionalities.
